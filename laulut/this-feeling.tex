\section{This Feeling}

\textit{Solo:}\\
I still feel the symptoms, do you get them too?\\
Am I different or is it a flu?\\
I should go see a doctor, so I could be sure.\\
But I just don’t want to get cured.

\textit{Everybody:}\\
‘Cause every time I drink I get this feeling\\
With every single sip I swear I could fly\\
Can’t you feel my thirst build so\\
I want it to grow,\\
So I can drink some more.

‘Cause every time I drink I feel extatic\\
And when I’ve drunk one down I run to the bar\\
I need to have some more drinks fast\\
I want this to last\\
Tonight, I’m sure, I’ll score.
