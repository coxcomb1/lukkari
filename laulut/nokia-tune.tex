\textit{Melody: Nokia tune}

Hello Finland!\\
Finland's awesome.\\
Finland rocks my soul.

You drink vodka\\
like it's water,\\
and you fish in holes.

You eat reindeer--\\
Dude, that's hardcore!\\
Pass the Rudolf, please.

You like hockey.\\
--You're a representative democracy\\
ruled by a 200-member unicameral parliament\\
called the Eduskunta--\\
And your asses freeze!
