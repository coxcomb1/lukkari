\section{Syphilis}
Syphilis,\\
it just started with a simple kiss\\
Now it even hurts to take a piss\\
Oh how did I get syphilis?

Yesterday\\
My cock was always coming out to play\\
Now it needs two weeks to hide away\\
Oh I believe in yesterday

Why her box was sick\\
I don't know, she wouldn't say\\
Now my dripping dick\\
won't get hard like yesterday-ay-ay-ay

Leprosy,\\
I'm not half the man I used to be\\
Now my fingertips are leaving me\\
Oh I believe I've leprosy.

Amputees.\\
You don't even have to spread their knees,\\
You can slide it in and out with ease,\\
Oh I believe in amputees.

Why, I had to come,\\
I don't know she wouldn't blow.\\
I stayed in too long.\\
Now I long for birth control.
