\section{Pour Me More}

All the people inside are cheerful\\
With all them we got the house full\\
We've lots of drinks I'm sure\\
Pour me more, pour me more, pour me more


The party doesn't show signs of stopping\\
I've some cake with tasty topping\\
Nobody seems eager to slow\\
Gimme skool, gimme skool, gimme skool


:,: When we stand on our chairs upright\\
I wish I could keep going on\\
But if you want more tonight\\
I'm sure there's a place to go on


The people are all retiring\\
It's late, it's fun, we're smiling\\
And as long as we've drinks to go\\
Let 'em flow, let 'em flow, let'em flow :,:
