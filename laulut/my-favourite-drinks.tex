\section{My Favourite Drinks}

Negroni, Manhattan, Tequila sunrise;\\
Gin Tonic, Blue Angel, a vodka on ice;\\
Campari orange, Ferrari, Tom Collins;\\
these are a few of my favourite drinks!

Screwdriver, Grasshopper, Apple Martini;\\
Black russian, White russian! Long island ice tea;\\
Little green fairies absinthe on their wings;\\
These are a few of my favourite drinks;

When the glass breaks;\\
or my hand shakes;\\
when I'm feeling sad;\\
I mix up a few of my favourite drinks,\\
and then I don't feel so bad!
